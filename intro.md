# What is a Docker container?

While you might hear about all the advanced usage of Docker, the concept of Docker containers is actually quite simple.

A Docker container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. Consider the container as a suitcase, you pack up all the belongings you need for daily life, and you will be able to survive in any part of the world. The container would contain code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings, everything you need to have the code run. As long as the remote environment supports a Docker container, you could expect your code to run in a container on the server exactly the same as it runs on your local computer.

As you might see, the Docker container aims to solve the kind of issue raised in the previous part. Despite being very powerful, creating a Docker container is fairly easy. In the next few sections, I will show you step-by-step how to create your own container.
